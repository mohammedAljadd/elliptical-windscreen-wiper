# elliptical-windscreen-wiper


This is my presentation of an elliptical windscreen wiper where I used solidworks to implement this project. 
The solution was using the mechanical cam to increase wiping area. This wiper is similar to Bosch's, and it is capable to wiper more area than regular ones do.
